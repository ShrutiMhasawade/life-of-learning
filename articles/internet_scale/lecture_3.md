Lecture 3 - Requirements and Specs
============

Things to consider when writing product requirements
* what technology allows?
* cost
* what do customer want?
* what you think is best?
* what differentiates you from competition?


User stories are a way to define user requirements. You think about requirements from a users point of view.


Architecture and design docs are used by
* engineers to organize thoughts
* testing/QA to develop test plans
* product management to look for disconnects in plan
You should update architecture and design docs to reflect how things are built
